# de.acegen

DSL (Domain Specific Language) and code generator implemented with Xtext based on [the ACE-architecture](#The-ACE-Architecture).

This tool helps you to write web-APIs and web-clients and can be plugged into Eclipse, Theia and VS Code.
You will benefit from:

- [expressive DSL](https://github.com/annettedorothea/TodoMVC---Server/blob/master/todo-server.ace) 
that makes documentation obsolete
- a code generator will write [boilerplate code](https://github.com/annettedorothea/TodoMVC---Server/tree/master/src/gen/java/com/anfelisa/todo) 
so you can focus on the business logic
- a simple but effective software architecture
- your precious business logic as the heart of your application is located in simple classes 
and is free of any dependency to a framework
- you will get a replayable timeline that might save your day when finding or reproducing a bug
- scenarios that result in executable integration tests and can even serve you as load tests (only for the web-API, for the UI we are still working on it)
- write less but simple unit tests 

See [https://todo.acegen.de](https://todo.acegen.de) for a simple todoMVC example.

## Installation
